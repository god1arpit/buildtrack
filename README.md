# BuildTrack — Construction Labour & Site Progress Management Platform

**BuildTrack** is a full-stack web and mobile-responsive platform designed for builders, contractors, and construction site supervisors (munshis) to manage daily labour activities, attendance, automated wage calculations, site progress milestones, materials expenses, and field updates from a single centralized dashboard.

The workspace also includes a road-construction inspection module. It uses a FastAPI service for project analytics and drone image/video frame processing, alongside the BuildTrack Express API.

## 🏗️ Core Features & Capabilities

### 1. Builder / Contractor Hub (Central Command)
- **Multi-Site Overview**: High-level KPI metrics across all active projects (Active Sites, Total Labour, Today's Turnout, Today's Wage Accrual, Net Pending Wages, Overall Progress %).
- **Site Progress & Milestones**: Track stage completion percentages (Foundation, Structure, Brickwork, Plaster, Electrical, Painting).
- **Labour Management**: Comprehensive worker directory with skills/trades (Mason, Carpenter, Painter, Plumber, Electrician, Bar Bender, Tiles Mason, Helper), daily wage rates, and overtime rates.
- **Automated Wage Engine**: Accurately computes basic wages (`days × daily rate`), overtime amounts (`OT hours × OT rate`), deductions, and pending wage liabilities.
- **Worker Payouts & Wage Slips**: Record wage payments (Cash, UPI, Bank Transfer) and print official labour wage slips.
- **Site Photos Gallery**: Categorized photo inspection (Work Progress, Materials Received, Issues/Damage, General Site Views) with lightbox preview.
- **Site Expense Tracker**: Log raw material costs (Cement, Steel, Bricks, Sand, Transport, Equipment).
- **AI Daily Briefs & Predictive Insights**: Automated daily executive summaries and intelligent risk alerts (e.g. low cement stock, high pending wage liabilities).
- **Auditing & Report Generation**: Printable attendance registers and wage disbursement ledgers.

### 2. Site Supervisor (Munshi) Mobile-First Experience
- **Touch-Optimized Fast Workflow**: Designed specifically for on-site mobile use.
- **1-Tap Attendance**: Large Present, Absent, Half Day, and Overtime buttons with "Mark All Present" shortcut.
- **End-of-Day Work Report**: Log work completed, progress slider (0–100%), checklist of finished tasks, material deliveries, bottlenecks, and tomorrow's plan.
- **Quick Site Photo Upload**: Direct photo capture and upload with categorization.
- **Emergency Expense Entry**: Record on-site purchases (e.g. emergency cement bags, transport, snacks).

### 3. Labour Worker Portal
- **Self-Service Wage & Attendance Ledger**: View total days worked, overtime hours clocked, total earnings, payments received, and pending balances.
- **Payment History & Receipts**: Transparent payment vouchers and transaction references.

### 4. Road Construction Inspection
- **Road Progress Review**: Inspect road-surface imagery and track progress, workforce, and equipment estimates by project.
- **Drone Media Upload**: Analyze supported images and a representative midpoint frame from supported videos.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Start the Backend API
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run seed     # Pre-populates realistic construction sites, labour & logs
npm start        # Runs Express API on http://localhost:5000
```

### 2. Start the Frontend Application
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev      # Runs Vite dev server on http://localhost:5173
```

### 3. Start the Road AI Service
```bash
cd backend
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The AI service health endpoint is `http://localhost:8000/api/health`. The Vite dev server proxies `/ai-api` and `/static` to this service. Start all three services (Express, Vite, and FastAPI) to use the complete application.

### Trained Road Mask Preview

The Builder AI workflow's **Preview Road Mask** action uses the stable checkpoint at `backend/models/road_boundary_mapillary_best.pth`. The inference runtime needs PyTorch and `segmentation-models-pytorch`; this workspace runs it from the root `.venv-roadtrain` environment. If the inference environment or checkpoint is stored elsewhere, set `BUILDTRACK_ROAD_MODEL_PYTHON` and `BUILDTRACK_ROAD_MODEL_CHECKPOINT` before starting FastAPI. The preview reports the share of pixels marked as road in one frame; it is not a project completion estimate and is still experimental.
